## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**juanfelipeber/juanfelipeber** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸŒ± I study Software Engineering at university and focus on technology platforms
- ğŸ”­ Currently, I program in Java. I work on small projects and plan to contribute to open-source on GitHub soon.
